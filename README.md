# Total RP 3: Extended Database Prototype

This is a prototype version of a proposed database overhaul.

**Use at your own risk.**
If you want to test this out I highly recommend making a database backup before.

# TODO list

- ~~cutscene, campaign, quest, step editor~~
- ~~handle nils properly in parameters (empty string input should mean nil in several cases)~~
- ~~make each tab remember what the user was looking at ("cursor")~~
- ~~add multi selection mode where feasible~~
- ~~add copy&paste for most structures~~
- reconsider the Notes frame accessibility, it should be more promiment
- ~~streamline the object browser, add a "this creation only" filter~~
- cut&paste maybe?
- ~~fix UI position and sizes in the effect editor~~
- ~~fix layering issues for some popups~~
- convert to Lua utility
- ~~integrate variable tags into the UI~~
- ~~integrate a lint like function~~
- localization
- ~~remove unused code~~
- ~~add a variable inspector~~
- older versions of Extended allowed for spaces in inner ids, decide on how to handle that
