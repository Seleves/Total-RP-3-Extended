# Total RP 3: Extended Database Prototype

This is a prototype version of a proposed database overhaul.

**Use at your own risk.**
If you want to test this out I highly recommend making a database backup before.

# TODO list

- cutscene, campaign, quest, step editor
- make each tab remember what the user was looking at ("cursor")
- add multi selection mode where feasible
- add copy&paste for most structures
- reconsider the Notes frame accessibility, it should be more promiment
- cut&paste maybe?
- fix UI position and sizes in the effect editor
- fix layering issues for some popups
- integrate variable tags into the UI
- integrate a lint like function
- localization
- remove unused code
- add a variable inspector
